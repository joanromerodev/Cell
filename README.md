# Cell
Find this project as useful as possible when it comes to understand the Cell and its parts
# Desc
In the project you'll find an interactive HTML element using CSS styles and images to represent each Cell's part and once you hover or click one specific part, it'll take you to the description of it.
This was made using HTML as the structure of each cell layer, then with CSS we had to style all the cell to make it look responsive and to organize the parts each on top of the others. 
With JavaScript, we created some functions that could help us with some animations and also to feed the Bootstrap Modal accessing to the object from JS and then iterating depending on the selected
cell's part.

# Version
Remember that this is only a prototype and in the future we could support this in a different way. If you want to support this project, feel free to clone it and work with it 
This is only a research project looking to help people to better understand the cell's part. For now we haven't worked in an English version but we'll do if required. 

Thank you.
